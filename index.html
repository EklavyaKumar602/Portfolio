            the specific economic stumbling blocks of various countries,
             Sachs espouses the use of what he terms "clinical economics", 
             by analogy to medicine. Sachs explains that countries, like patients, 
             are complex systems, requiring differential diagnosis, an understanding of context,
              monitoring and evaluation, and professional standards of ethics.[1] 
              Clinical economics requires a methodic analysis and "differential diagnosis" 
              of a country's economic problems, followed by a specifically tailored prescription.
               Many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, 
               including government corruption; legal and social disparities based on gender,
                ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as AIDS and malaria; lack of infrastructure
                 (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); 
                 unstable political landscapes; protectionism; and geographic barriers.
             Sachs discusses each factor, and its potential remedies, in turn.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, 
            skills, and character traits. T
            here are many debates about its precise definition, 
            for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. 
            A further issue is whether part of the meaning of 
            education is that the change in the student is an improvement. 
            Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish 
            education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify,
             measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental 
             states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic
              field studying education.</p>
